				<p>On observing the miserable conditions of several senior citizens and street children, Sri P. Eswar Reddy,
					Retired Superintendent, Z.P Office, Chittoor; had decided to help such needy aged people and children. Immediately after
					his retirement he has initiated and established this Hare Rama Kshetram public charitable trust.</p>
				<p>The main aim of the trust is to provide free care and support to the elderly people and orphans.</p>

					<strong>Humble Appeal</strong>
				</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The trust is requesting broad minded and good people to join their hands to help in running the orphan. The trust
					is currently being run with very limited funds to look after all the needs of elderly people. Join your hands in
					this noble cause to bring light to the people living in the dark. Even a small help would make a big difference.
